# Front-End-Project

## Purpose 
An application that allows the user to plan a night of events. The user is prompted with the choice to either plan a night out or a night in. When a user selects to plan a night out, they are prompted to enter their zip code and shown a list of events, restaurants, and movies in theaters near them. When a user selects to plan a night in, they are given a random recipe.
